## FAQ

**Does Deel support both employee EOR services and independent contractor management?**

Yes, Deel provides comprehensive solutions for both employment models with distinct pricing: Contractor Management at $49/month includes automated invoicing, 1099 generation, bulk payments, and compliance support, while Contractor of Record at $325/month adds misclassification protection. Full EOR services at $599/month per employee handle legal employment, payroll, tax compliance, benefits administration, and local labor law adherence across 150+ countries without requiring entity establishment. Businesses can mix employment types on single platform—combining contractors, Contractor of Record, and EOR employees—with unified dashboard managing all worker classifications and compliance requirements.

**How quickly can companies hire international employees using global employment platforms?**

Modern EOR platforms like Deel, RemoFirst, and Borderless AI enable international hiring within 24 hours to one week after account setup, dramatically accelerating the 3-6 months typically required establishing foreign legal entities. Borderless AI's AI-powered automation generates contracts in minutes and completes onboarding under 10 minutes, while RemoFirst guarantees 24-hour onboarding capability and Deel typically processes international hires within one week. Traditional providers like Velocity Global or enterprise solutions like ADP require extended timelines (weeks to months) due to manual processes and complex workflows, though comprehensive implementation support ensures compliance across jurisdictions.

**What cost savings do EOR platforms provide versus establishing foreign entities?**

Companies avoid $15,000-$50,000 in upfront costs establishing each foreign legal entity plus ongoing $20,000-$40,000 annually maintaining compliance, accounting, and legal requirements per country when using EOR services. RemoFirst's $199/month per employee delivers 60-75% savings versus premium providers; a 10-person international team costs $1,990 monthly ($23,880 annually) with RemoFirst versus $5,990 monthly ($71,880 annually) with $599 EOR providers—saving $48,000 per year. Additional savings include eliminating compliance penalties ($10,000-$100,000 per misclassification incident), reducing global HR management time by 15-20 hours per pay period, and avoiding 3-6 month market entry delays enabling faster revenue generation in new territories.
